        <h2 class="section">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>One of the questions that I have been asked the most often during my misadventures in the Internet sphere, the
            question that, today, would put me in a state of weariness, whereas before it was dear to me, is probably
            the one about resources to consult, as well as the method to adopt to excel in the field of programming and
            more generally in computer science.</p>
        <p>This question has led to thousands of typed characters, dozens of hours spent, and eventually people who are
            as - if not more - lost than they were before inflicting upon themselves the burden of having dared to ask
            this cursed question. The blame is nevertheless not to be attributed to the questioner, who, in an
            investigative approach and in the hope of escaping the factory of the average Man, simply wanted an escape
            from a destiny that seemed blurry and terrible to them.</p>
        <p>Indeed, I have for my part long been the collaborator of such a system, which has obviously resulted in no
            success. Thinking I was doing well and being useful, I have, on the contrary, fueled the cause of
            failures. These experiences have nevertheless taught me to better understand the situation, this situation
            in which the majority of young people find themselves today, namely a dichotomy that opposes a range of
            desires to an arsenal of laziness.</p>
        <p>That is why, in order to express in detail our observations on the subject, and in the hope of perhaps
            helping anyone who has the courage to read our entire thought, we have decided to write this article. The
            reason for its existence comes first of all from a weariness of having to constantly reiterate the same
            arguments. This article thus aims to be an "ultimate" piece of writing that would compile all our
            observations, advice, and warnings for anyone seeking to excel in a field, and more particularly in that of
            computer science.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Today</h2>

        <p>It is first necessary to establish an assessment of the situation in which many young people, or almost all
            of them, are immersed. The thing is clear: once a certain level is reached in the school curriculum,
            students are forced to choose their destiny which will ultimately decide their future profession, or at
            least field of activity. Many are those who, while they did not have to worry about their future until then,
            realize that they know neither what to do with their present, nor even less with their future. While their
            major concern up to this point was only the next entertainment they were going to consume, they are suddenly
            forced to make choices about their future. With neither real passion, motivation, nor real objective in
            life, their own existence can almost be perceived as without interest.</p>
        <p>The bubble in which they had locked themselves throughout their childhood, this comfortable bubble where
            expertise is their quality, then turns out to be the worst vice into which they have fallen. The realization
            of this situation is very common, hence the enormous interest in "self-improvement" videos found
            on the internet. Many have come to this bitter conclusion that their daily life is nothing but mediocrity
            and wasted time, consumption and depravation. This is followed by a sudden gain in motivation, the most
            motivated among them followed and applied to the letter each of the pieces of advice they encountered:
            sports, schedule, meditation, reading, and so on.</p>
        <p>A few weeks or even days later, back to square one. Morale is then even more demolished than it was at the
            start, efforts seem vain and the situation seems to be without solution.</p>
        <p>There are several errors that have been committed and that I have observed myself. The main one is to
            have convinced oneself that the solution to one's problems lies in a guide, or multitudes of
            instructions to apply, to gain success. In reality, the same people who complained about their lack of
            motivation, interests in anything, and clear direction, have just committed the biggest intellectual
            laziness possible. This intellectual laziness rests on the myth that success is deterministic and is
            obtained by vigorously following a set of principles. It has become so ingrained in their mentality that
            they have not even realized the absurdity into which they have sunk.</p>
        <p>Our experiences have rather led us to conclude that success is not sought, it is discovered. What can be
            defined as "success" is not only specific to each person, but the path to get there is just as
            much. Imposing a schedule, a working method, or constraints on oneself is the sign of a wrong path, one that
            is more likely to lead to disappointment than anything else. The "key to success" has become a
            business in its own right, the situation is such that intellectual deliverance is cherished and coveted.
            Many are those who desire, few are those who act, even fewer are those who manage to deliver themselves from
            their fate.</p>
        <p>The path to success first passes through a change of mentality, a realization of the importance and urgency
            of the situation, and a real conviction that everything is possible if one gives oneself the means to
            believe in it. With the right mentality, objectives will be achieved naturally, and nothing will seem like a
            task anymore. With the right mentality, the "means" by which to achieve success or the working
            method to adopt will no longer even be questions.</p>
        <p>The following paragraphs seek to instill this mentality in the reader, and to pose them face to face with an
            ultimatum for which they will not have a second chance. The tone is deliberately raw, and - from our
            interactions - may have displeased some to whom we have given the experience.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Passivity</h2>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Until now in this article, no word has been defined to describe the people who find themselves in the
                situation mentioned previously. For the sake of ease, these will be named by the term
                "passive", while their disease will have the name of "passivity". Not all passives
                are equal and the world is obviously more complex than the binary that seems to emerge below, but for
                the sake of brevity and simplicity, we will stop at generalities. We will oppose here
                "passivity" to "activity".</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The world is made up of passives and actives. Passives are the direct product of the modern world, where
            entertainment has become the heart of the daily life of many, serving mainly as a means of mental
            stupefaction. Fiction, video games, series, films, manga or anime, all serve directly or indirectly to
            produce beings devoid of any inspiration: preferring to indulge in what they know best (consuming), passives
            isolate themselves from their own lives by projecting themselves onto fictional characters who feed their
            fantasies and empty discussions of interest with their equally passive colleagues.</p>
        <p>The existence of passives is characterized by a monotonous directive, empty of liveliness, and
            indistinguishable from the millions of other passives that populate this Earth. Passives are the first
            consumers and most faithful customers of entertainment. The typical day of a passive is summed up by seeking
            the next dish that will disconnect them from their own reality, while burying their problems and questions
            about their future. We don't know to whom the passive delegates the keys to their life, but what is
            certain is that they act as an observer (something they already know very well how to do in front of their
            screen) and no longer as an actor in it. The situation of passives is such that one would believe they are
            waiting for a messiah who would get them out of their situation.</p>
        <p>Passives are regularly looking for an instruction manual that would guide them towards activity, but their
            disease always resurfaces. Whatever advice is given, they will fall back into their mediocrity. Passives
            make a big mistake: their passivity will never be broken through someone else, the only rampart against
            passivity being the passive themselves. Behind passivity hides a fear, the fear of detaching from one's
            miserable routine, the fear of change and the fear of having to leave one's comfortable nest. The
            passives of today are the deserters of tomorrow's front.</p>
        <p>Passives are perfect employees: their passivity makes them exemplary subjects. Passives are perfect
            customers: their passivity makes them the most faithful consumers. Passives exist only to fuel the gear in
            which they have found themselves. No one remembers the life of a passive. No one envies the life of a
            passive. No one sees inspiration in the life of a passive. Passivity should be the terror of every person.
            On the contrary, passivity seems to have been democratized, even almost praised. We congratulate ourselves
            on having read our hundredth manga, we congratulate ourselves on having reached ten thousand hours of
            gameplay, or on finishing our third series of the day.</p>
        <p>At the age of senility, the passive will recall their life, a life in which they will have accomplished
            nothing, except what billions of other human beings have already accomplished before their birth. "At
            least, I have been a good person" they will say to themselves, infected by their passivity which will
            have accompanied them to their deathbed.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The lazy are those who have the most worry, grief and sadness; they have neither happiness nor joy,
                unlike people who are very active and hardworking, in everything they do."</p>
            - Ibn al Qayyim
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="section">Activity</h2>

        <p>Actives are those who - animated by their passion and their obsession, in an almost divine design - gorge
            themselves with knowledge, defy the hazards and any circumstances that could hinder their quest. Whatever
            their situation, they will always find a way to excel: money, time or social class are not brakes for them.
        </p>
        <p>Among the actives are those who have entered history through their innovations, research and contributions to
            the good of society. Among the actives are all those who, in an unquenchable and unstoppable thirst to
            always want to learn more, break the ordinary and manage to dominate their respective field. Their existence
            will have been marked by multiple adventures, victories and defeats, all as remarkable as each other and all
            having had a more or less important impact on their surroundings.</p>
        <p>Actives are those who build the world of tomorrow through their work and their courage. Actives are those
            whose names will be remembered, those whose works will have contributed to the good and to technical or
            intellectual progression. They are a source of inspiration, of models and of admiration. Their singularity
            differentiates them from their passive antonym.</p>
        <p>Many make the mistake of considering activity as an acquired trait at birth. On the contrary, activity can be
            a trait that can develop early or late in a person's life. Activity is not intimately linked to a
            person's intelligence, although the latter can be a vector for it. Through activity, Man exploits his
            facultative capacities and his potential in its entirety. Through activity, Man constantly pushes his limits
            and his only barrier then becomes the time he has left to live: his ascent is exponential and his desire to
            break the chains of ignorance is unequaled.</p>
        <p>It remains for the reader to undertake one of the two paths that have been laid out for him, and to assume
            the full consequences.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The illiterates of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot
                learn, unlearn and relearn.</p>
            - Alvin Toffler
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="section">Liberation</h2>

        <p>Faced with this dilemma, it is clear that the choice of activity is the ideal of all - except perhaps the few
            dissidents in full denial. It now remains to know how to free oneself from the yoke of passivity, in order
            to switch to the path of activity.</p>
        <p>Among the most frequent errors that I have been able to observe, and which all come from a naivety and a
            misunderstanding of the situation, there is the fact of radically ceasing everything that can be considered
            unproductive, useless or an "obstacle to concentration". This is how we can see people challenging
            themselves to completely stop social networks, to disconnect entirely from the internet or even to pursue
            other radical methods such as the adoption of "dumbphones" in a perspective of digital detox.</p>
        <p>The reality is that such directives are futile and doomed to failure. Without real conviction, with social
            networks or not, nothing will change. Activity is not acquired by magic, it cannot be forced either. It is
            something that a person turns to after having fully grasped its workings. Its manifestation transcends the
            entertainments that could divert the passive in their quest for knowledge. Naturally, the addictions which
            the passive was confronted with will disappear to give way to an unstoppable monster hungry for knowledge.
            Entertainment will then all seem bland, to the point that activity itself will be the substitute. It is
            important to note that switching to activity does not mean stopping all distraction. The point to grasp is
            that activity transforms pastimes from recurring events to sporadic events.</p>
        <p>There is no recipe for activity. The way to get out of passivity is your own. You are the architect of your
            life, do not expect a ready-made solution from others. Aspire to become someone better, and fight to make
            this dream a reality. Whether it is through self-hatred, hatred of others or through your immense ego, use
            any means as a vector and carrier of your life project. This allows us to make the transition to the initial
            subject that led us to write this article: "How to learn and excel in computer science?".</p>
        <p>Computer science is a very particular field. Unlike other fields, computer science is not mastered by having
            consulted and memorized the maximum number of books on the subject. What distinguishes a good programmer
            from a bad one is not the number of books or articles read, but rather his experience and the variety of his
            works. One of the most widespread myths - and whose falsity has always seemed obvious to me - is that of
            affirming that the school system is a producer of good programmers. Thereby, many people rely solely on
            school to learn the field, while thinking they are doing the right thing. School is not only the worst
            factory of programmers, but it is also the best producer of human clones whose abilities and skills are not
            only ridiculously low, but also indistinguishable from their school-graduated colleagues. It is not uncommon
            to have one or two people in a class who master the field more than their own teachers, and whose lead is
            counted in equivalent school years. Such people are those who, during their free time, indulge in projects
            that bring them not only education, but also entertainment, even income for the most entrepreneurial among
            them.</p>
        <p>The static and backward nature of the educational system is not compatible with the mobility and dynamism of
            computer science. Education will always have a lag, a lag that can only be compensated by mobilizing means
            that only private schools can afford. This defect of the system is in reality an advantage that anyone can
            exploit: it is today very easy to outperform the majority of school graduates. Thus, computer science is
            distinguished by its ability to form self-taught elites, something inconceivable elsewhere.</p>
        <p>In an increasingly connected world where knowledge resources are almost infinite, the key to excellence is
            within reach. This is acquired by constantly developing projects that are a source of motivation, by
            constantly pushing one's limits, and by not considering abandonment as one's first option. Knowledge
            in computer science is built progressively, through trial and error, in an infinite spiral whose only limit
            is you. Begin your adventure with an idea, stop wasting your time building a knowledge base beforehand. The
            latter will naturally form through all the questions and issues you will encounter in the realization of
            your project.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Subjugation</h2>

        <p>This world is designed to accommodate the passive Man. The passive man, as has been
            aforesaid, lives from day-to-day, incapable of a higher construct of an overarching plan. The
            common Man, enigmatically, fills his daily life with mindless, meaningless and meritless
            pastimes and leisures. To him, what can be done today can rather be deferred to tomorrow, thus
            he imprisons himself of living in the yesterday of today, perpetuating himself into that vicious
            cycle. This is, inexplicably, something done out of his own volition, the common Man chooses
            nigh daily to sabotage his own potential and destiny. It is a sad but an undeniable fact of life that
            the majority participate in such a self-destructive lifestyle, and I observe this phenomena and
            lifestyle in an unfettered and distilled form in no better place than the passive Man's way of life.
            It can be observed in all quarters of his life.</p>
        <p>This outlook of the common Man might be perceived, for some, as callous, self-conceited and
            narcissistic. Nonetheless, I earnestly implore you to commit to a moment of true reflection, how
            many people in your life truly devote their life to a higher purpose? This is the foregoing higher
            construct I speak of, the belief of committing to a certain set of means for an end. For the
            average Man, this possibility intimidates him, as many are offered by life a set of choices, most
            of whom will choose the easiest one, whether that be out of convenience, ease, inertia and what
            have you. I consider it a great insult and desertion of mankind, your tribe, and most importantly,
            yourself, to let oneself become a victim of the passage of time. Yet, life is the true subjugator of
            Man, he enslaves man by bestowing the weight of life on him until he succumbs to the pain and
            ultimately resigns. This, a temptation I and many people can resonate with, one that is shared
            by many, is what I will now neologize as “subjugation,” perpetrated by life, in which all are
            victims to varying degrees.</p>
        <p>During the process of liberation, one will encounter what can only be described as traps, life
            being the architect of those traps. Be mindful of the fact that these are traits rather than
            archetypes, many characterizations can overlap with each other. Nuances are to be accounted
            for, not all humans can fit into categories, and consequently more observation is needed to
            discern these characters.</p>
        <p>A common method I have been a personal witness of, and can confidently testify for, is the
            allure of money. I am unsure of whether money is the end or the means that people are
            deceived by. Simply, do people want to live a life of luxury because of the ease that comes with,
            or is it that money is the means for which allows you to live out your fantasies and desires?
            Perhaps it is a mix of both. Nevertheless, you will encounter many in your life, whose only true
            priority lies in the numbers, and assuring himself that it stays in the green upwards trajectory, it
            is his only source of fulfillment and aspiration, a sense of security that he has traded for
            unrealized potential. He does not even necessitate copious amounts of wealth, it can be paltry
            for all the passive Man is satiated by. I have personal anecdotes and experiences with people
            who have traded their aspirations and morals for money, the irony being that if they pursued
            those aspirations, the final outcome would have been more favorable and advantageous. The
            avenue of which they generate income is often insipid and uninspiring, and occasionally sordid,
            very rarely will you see a commendable project or craft produced by the passive Man, specially
            by the morally bankrupt, who embellish and resort to unimpressive glorified stunts they refer to
            as feats of accomplishment or actions.</p>
        <p>Additionally, many are suppressed from their potential by fear. The fear of uncertainty, the fear
            of a possible failure. The passive Man sees this as a compelling enough force to deter him from
            reaching his destiny. The active, however, is unphased by this possibility, as he has devoted his
            life for this purpose and to him it is all he should know, failure is something that should not
            occupy his mind. To perseverate is fruitless, it will invariably lead Man into despair and
            hopelessness. Think to yourself, what does pondering about failure truly achieve? Do you think
            the highest achievers in life allot time in their already strenuous day to reflect on this, or is it
            more likely they continue, which I am sure to him is the only path forward.</p>
        <p>Lastly, and most importantly, do not become a cog in the machine, let your aspirations stray
            away, as far as possible, from such an outcome. Life has been designed for catering to the
            passive Man in the last few centuries, to accomodate the passive, with a goal in mind to mold
            the malleable people into compliant, uninspired, apathetic and unenthusiastic workers. They
            want to churn out passives at an industrial scale. The most successful figures throughout time
            have been those who relentlessly pursue a goal, their sights set for the top of the mountain of
            which they will surmount. It is in life's interest to keep you resting on your laurels, to make you
            no more than what it wants you to be, of which life will be the greatest benefactor of in assuring
            you of this destiny. The solution to such a problem is simple: Be relentless. Utilize every positive
            quality of your mind and body and gallop towards your objective.</p>
        <p>The inner workings of the passive Man will continue to remain incomprehensible to me. Why he
            chooses to operate under the premises of a set of factors in his life that negate that of which is
            beneficial. Factors that will inevitably lead to his failure and defeat. The allure of money, the fear
            of failure and the complacency are the most common seductions committed by life, it is those
            who you should be familiar with, but remain vigilant, internals of its glamour hard to discern. This
            writing piece was not written with the intent to reinforce a conceited way of life, but a plea to the
            reader that there is a possibility for glory.</p>
